  > New version added `filesexist` command!
  Use this tool to manage your audiobook library from the
  command line. You can can add/list/rate books and mark
  them as completed. The library can be exported in a
  cli friendly format as well as html.
  This snap is using strict confinement meaning that you
  can only access files in your home folder. If your 
  collection of audio books is stored somewhere else you
  can use a bind mount to make them available to the snap.
  Like
    mkdir /home/you/audiobooks
    sudo mount --bind /storage/audiobooks /home/you/audiobooks/
